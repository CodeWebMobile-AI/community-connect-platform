# Community Connect Platform

**A geo-location based platform for local community resource and skill sharing. Build connections and foster local sustainability.**

## About Community Connect

Community Connect aims to solve the problem of disconnected local communities by providing a centralized platform for residents to share resources, skills, and needs. Our vision is to build stronger, more sustainable communities where neighbors can easily connect, support each other, and thrive.

### Problem Statement

Local communities lack centralized platforms for sharing resources, skills, and needs, leading to underutilized assets and limited social interaction. This platform addresses that problem directly.

### Target Audience and Value Proposition

**Target Audience:** Residents of neighborhoods, towns, and cities who want to connect with their neighbors, share resources, offer services, and build a stronger local community.

**Value Proposition:**

*   **Easy Connection:** Quickly find and connect with neighbors offering resources, skills, or requesting help.
*   **Resource Optimization:**  Reduce waste and promote sustainability by sharing underutilized items.
*   **Skill Sharing:**  Learn new skills, offer your expertise, and support local talent.
*   **Community Building:**  Foster stronger relationships and a sense of belonging within your community.
*   **Convenience:**  A centralized platform accessible from anywhere, anytime.

## Features

### Initial Features:

*   **User Registration and Profile Creation with Geolocation Support:** Securely register and create a profile with your location, enabling proximity-based connections.
*   **Listing Resources (items to lend/give away):** List items you're willing to lend or give away, with descriptions and images.
*   **Listing Skills Offered (services):** List the skills you offer, including descriptions, pricing, and availability.
*   **Listing Needs (requests):** List your requests for help or items you need, with descriptions and urgency levels.
*   **Geolocation-based Search:** Search for resources, skills, and needs within a specified radius of your location.

### Future Customizations:

*   **Geolocation Functionality:** Restrict resource and skill sharing to a defined radius around the user.
*   **Robust Rating and Review System:**  Build trust and accountability with a rating and review system for service providers.
*   **Messaging System:** Secure and private communication between users.
*   **AI-Powered Matching Algorithm:** Suggest resources, skills, and needs that align with user profiles.
*   **Reporting and Moderation System:**  Address inappropriate content or behavior.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React.js (for a dynamic user interface)
*   **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js (for a scalable and efficient API)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (for reliable data storage)
*   **Geolocation:** Google Maps API (for location services)
*   **Real-time Messaging:** Socket.IO (for real-time updates and chat)
*   **AI-Powered Recommendation Engine:** Python with TensorFlow/PyTorch (for personalized suggestions)

## Architecture Overview

[Detailed architecture diagrams and descriptions will be included here as the project progresses.  This will cover the frontend, backend, database, and external API integrations.]

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js (v16 or higher)
*   npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn
*   PostgreSQL
*   A Google Maps API key
*   [Other API keys as needed, detailed below]

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    cd community-connect-platform
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for the backend:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install  # or yarn install
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies for the frontend:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install # or yarn install
    cd ..
    ```

4.  **Set up the database:**

    *   Create a PostgreSQL database named `community_connect`.
    *   Run the database migrations located in `backend/db/migrations` using a migration tool like Knex or Sequelize.  (Specific instructions on how to run migrations will be added to the `backend` directory.)

## Environment Setup

1.  **Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.**
    Populate it with the following environment variables, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:

    ```
    PORT=3001  # Or your desired backend port
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/community_connect
    GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
    BACKGROUND_CHECK_API_KEY=YOUR_BACKGROUND_CHECK_API_KEY # If implementing background checks
    PUSHER_APP_ID=YOUR_PUSHER_APP_ID # If implementing real time messaging with pusher
    PUSHER_APP_KEY=YOUR_PUSHER_APP_KEY # If implementing real time messaging with pusher
    PUSHER_APP_SECRET=YOUR_PUSHER_APP_SECRET # If implementing real time messaging with pusher
    AI_RECOMMENDATION_API_URL=YOUR_AI_RECOMMENDATION_API_URL # If implementing recommendations
    ```

    *   **GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY:** Get a key from the Google Maps API console.
    *   **BACKGROUND_CHECK_API_KEY:** Get a key from your chosen background check provider (e.g., Checkr, Sterling).  Needed only if implementing.
    *   **PUSHER_APP_ID, PUSHER_APP_KEY, PUSHER_APP_SECRET:** Get these credentials from the Pusher dashboard if using.  Needed only if implementing.
    *   **AI_RECOMMENDATION_API_URL:**  If using a separate service for AI recommendations, provide the URL here.  Needed only if implementing.
    *   **DATABASE_URL:** Your PostgreSQL connection string.

2.  **Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory.**

    ```
    REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001  # Or the URL of your backend
    REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
    ```

    *   **REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL:** The URL of your backend server.
    *   **REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY:** Your Google Maps API key (for frontend use).

## Development Workflow

1.  **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev # Or your preferred start script (e.g., `node server.js`)
    cd ..
    ```

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start # or yarn start
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Develop your features:**  Follow these guidelines:

    *   **Branching:** Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
    *   **Coding Standards:**  Adhere to [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/) (or your team's chosen coding style).
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Submit a pull request for code review before merging into the `main` branch.
    *   **Documentation:** Document your code clearly.

## Testing

*   **Backend:** Use Jest and Supertest for API testing.  (Example tests will be provided in the `backend/test` directory.)
*   **Frontend:** Use Jest and React Testing Library for component testing.  (Example tests will be provided in the `frontend/src/tests` directory.)

To run tests:

```bash
cd backend
npm test
cd ..

cd frontend
npm test
cd ..
```

## Deployment

[Detailed deployment instructions will be added here, including options for deploying to platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.]

## Monetization Strategy

The Community Connect Platform utilizes a freemium model:

*   **Basic Features (Free):** Listing resources, skills, and needs; basic search functionality; standard user profiles.
*   **Premium Features (Paid):**
    *   **Background Checks:** Allow service providers to undergo optional background checks to build trust (users pay for the check).
    *   **Promoted Listings:** Allow users to pay to have their listings featured and appear higher in search results.
    *   **Advertising Options for Local Businesses:** Local businesses can advertise their services to platform users within a defined radius.
